# Development

Please follow this instructions to be sure that we all have the same library
versions (it may take 30 minutes or more to install all packages).

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From now, every time that you want to run the main or other code first load the
environment with

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
